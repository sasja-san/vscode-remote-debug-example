**[HERE](https://github.com/sasja-san/vscode-remote-debug-example)** is the link to the repository.
The Rust projects code is available there, in the `rust-proj` directory.


This tutorial will guide you through the steps needed to set up a remote debugging session of a rust program from within VS Code.

On the way there be some introductory guides to using `gdb`, the GNU Debugger, as well as setting up a remote session with it.
This is because VS Code will make use of a `gdbserver`, so it's best to make sure it works before you go on to the VS Code configuration.

The tutorial chapters are available through the top menu/hamburger button.
